This simple crawler will find every artist it can on Dour festival's website and then allow you to filter by year and tag.
Use "./dour fetch" to crawl the website and "./dour -year=2015 -tag=electro" to filter the crawled data to find electro artist that were scheduled in 2015.
This was made under 2hours after wanting more filtering options to search better for artists.
